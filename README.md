# 📝 Centralized Logging with ELK Stack (v8.17.2) using Python Logs

This project demonstrates how to set up a centralized logging system using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) on macOS. A simple Python application generates logs, which are then parsed by Logstash and visualized in Kibana.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- 🔹 Logs generated by a Python script (`age_verification.py`)
- 🔹 Log entries written to a local file (`age_verification.log`)
- 🔹 Logstash reads and parses the file
- 🔹 Structured logs are sent to Elasticsearch
- 🔹 Kibana visualizes and analyzes log data

This setup is designed for local development and educational use, but follows production-level practices.

## 🧱 Stack Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Elasticsearch 8.17.2**
- **Logstash 8.17.2**
- **Kibana 8.17.2**
- **macOS (Local Environment)**

## ⚙️ How to Run

### 1. Set Up ELK Stack

- Download and extract Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana from:
  https://www.elastic.co/downloads/
- Launch Elasticsearch:
  ```bash
  ./bin/elasticsearch
  
Launch Kibana:
./bin/kibana

Save the generated credentials and SSL certificate (typically http_ca.crt)

2. Configure Logstash
Update paths in logstash.conf:

Log file path: path => "/absolute/path/to/age_verification.log"

SSL cert path: cacert => "/path/to/http_ca.crt"

Credentials: user and password (from Elasticsearch)

Run Logstash:
./bin/logstash -f config/logstash.conf

3. Run the Python App
python age_verification.py

This will start generating logs in age_verification.log.

4. View Logs in Kibana
Open Kibana at http://localhost:5601

Navigate to Discover

Create a Data View for index: python-log-index

Explore your logs!

Best Practices Followed
sincedb_path => "/dev/null" used to avoid persistent log state during development

SSL certificate trusted on macOS for secure Elasticsearch connection

Logs follow timestamp-level-message format for easy parsing

Clean separation between log generation and ingestion layers
